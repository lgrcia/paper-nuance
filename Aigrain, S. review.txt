A few comments:
- in Section 2 I don’t think you describe anywhere how you fit for the GP HPs. I guess this is done before beginning the transit search, on the whole LC, but it probably should be stated! Indeed it’s discussed in more detail when you talk about the applications to TESS data, but I think it should be outlined in section 2 also
- if you want to cite the earliest use of the 2-step strategy (single-transit search then period search), I believe it is in Aigrain & Irwin (2004), section 2.9, paragraph 3 - admittedly, it’s buried in a lot of other stuff so hard to spot.
- Regarding the choice of kernel, I’ve been wondering if there’s really a need for a kernel that fully describes the correlated noise in the whole LC, or if anything that does a reasonable job of capturing the variability on transit timescales would do, even if it doesn’t exploit (e.g.) the quasi-periodic nature of the signal. Is that something you’ve explored?
- On a similar note, for PLATO one thing that worries me is granulation noise, which occurs on timescales shorter than the transit. Based on Figure 8 of your paper, there may still be something to be gained by explicitly modelling the correlated noise when its characteristic timescale is shorter than the transit (tau<1), but I wondered if by any chance you’ve tested nuance on any real-life cases where this applies, like TESS light curves of evolved stars? Perhaps something for a later paper
- As your plots show (eg figure 5), the dependence of the likelihood on duration is quite weak. I would suggest that a simple way to speed up the linear search would be to coarsen the grid of trial durations (note that this applies to BLS too of course, so it doesn’t alter the comparison between nuance and BLS-based methods).
- You mention that the single-search is the least optimised part of nuance. In my old implementation of the BLS (the one described in that Aigrain & Irwin paper above), I tried to be super efficient by keeping track of the sums over the data points that went into the SNR estimate for the single transit. Then when changing T0 from one value to the next, I’d only need to add the contributions from points that moved into the transit, and remove those from points that moved out of it, rather than evaluate the sums over the in-transit points from scratch. I wondered if something similar could be done for the sums that go into equation 5 in your paper. Of course it’s a lot more complex, but in theory it could be done, no? If the trial T0s are the observation times, the only thing that changes between two neighbouring values of T0 for equation 5 is that one element of the last row X goes from zero to unity, and one from unity to zero. Surely there’s something to be exploited in that?

A few very minor comments (I ran out of time, so towards the end of the draft I stopped noting the typos and such and focused more on the content):
- there’s a couple of typos in the 3rd paragraph of section 2: full-fledge -> fully fledged, and correlate -> correlated
- above equation 4: I understand that the components of the design matrix not used to describe the transit can be set to (e.g.) low-order polynomials, or housekeeping parameters such as airmass, seeing or satellite pointing (say), so that the model also describes instrumental effects. However, I think this will be less obvious to a reader who isn’t already familiar with (e.g.) Foreman-Mackey et al. (2015), so perhaps you could say it explicitly. 
- on a related point, in footnote 3: I understand your point about the other elements of w being irrelevant to the transit search, but it might be useful to evaluate it to visualise the instrumental component of the model no?
- just after equation 6: The sentence “So that: <equation>.” isn’t grammatically correct. Either change to “…, so that <equation>.” or “…. In that case: <equation>.”
- Caption of figure 5: the statement that you don’t need to vary T0 confused me, because the x-axis of the plots in b) is phase, so you are in effect varying T0… Maybe rephrase somehow?
- just before section 2.5: ones -> once
- section 2.5: can you comment on the computing time required for BLS (or in section 2.6, biweight + BLS) vs nuance?
- p. 11, there’s a cross-reference missing just above the equation giving the distributions for the SHO kernel parameters
- section 3.2, 2nd para: for each of the studied target -> targets
- caption of Figure 9: “Top plot” -> “The top plot”
- Just after the heading “stellar variability kernel"
